# Weather-Service-Manager

A Java program that acts as a weather service manager. It uses a third-party API to fetch weather data for two cities, compares their current temperatures, and determines which city has the higher current temperature. Additionally, it calculates the city with the greatest temperature range based on the difference between the high and low temperatures.
